This repository contains image datasets of sheep udders, categorized into two main conditions: Subclinical Mastitis and Healthy Udders. The datasets are from two separate collection periods, November 2022 and May 2023. The Healthy Udders images from November 2022 are further divided into two parts: Pt.1 and Pt.2, for easier navigation and use.
